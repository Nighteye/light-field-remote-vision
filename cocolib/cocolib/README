COCOLIB is a library for convex continuous optimization,
focusing on the minimization of functionals of the type

E(u) = J(u) + F(u)

where u is an image (i.e. vector-valued function on an interval),
J is a convex and closed regularizer, and F a convex and closed
data term (e.g. inverse problems, inpainting, segmentation ...).


COCOLIB is hosted on SourceForge. Check the homepage for the most
recent version and documentation:

https://sourceforge.net/p/cocolib/

Offline documentation is available in "../docs".

This is the library directory. From here, you can build both
the library "cocolib/libcocolib.a" via

> qmake cocolib.pro
> make
